DESCRIPTION
       PolyGlot as adapter and book engine

       PolyGlot is a "UCI adapter".  It connects a GUI interface (such as
       XBoard, Winboard, Arena or Chessbase) to a UCI chess engine.

       By specifying an opening book (in PolyGlot book format) chess engines
       can transparently use such books.

       PolyGlot understands the two main GUI protocols: UCI and xboard.
       Normally the protocol will be auto detected but this can be overridden
       in the configuration file.

       In xboard mode PolyGlot fully translates between the xboard and UCI
       protocols.  In addition it tries to solve known problems with other
       adapters.  For instance, it detects and reports draws by fifty-move
       rule, repetition, etc ... It also supports Chess960.

       When in UCI mode PolyGlot mostly passes commands from the GUI to the
       engine and vice versa, except that it will play book moves on behalf of
       the engine when the occasion arises.

       The engine options are exported as UCI options in UCI mode and as
       "feature option=" commands in xboard mode. The latter form an extension
       of the xboard protocol as defined by H.G. Muller.

       Options which normally appear in the [PolyGlot] section of the config
       file (see below) are exported as options with their name prefixed by
       "Polyglot". This makes it easy to filter them in the GUI.

       NOTE: Not all options are exported, only those that make sense in the
       given mode.

       Book making utilities

       PolyGlot supports the "PolyGlot opening book format". This is the
       defacto standard non-proprietary opening book format. It is fully
       documented here

       http://alpha.uhasselt.be/Research/Algebra/Toga/book_format.html

       Roughly speaking a PolyGlot opening book is a collection of triples
       (position, move, weight). A "position" is represented by a 64-bit
       Zobrist hash key. The weight is proportional to the probability the
       move should be played.

       Other opening book formats such as ChessBase's .ctg format and Arena's
       .abk format are undocumented and proprietary. They can only be used by
       their own GUIs.

       PolyGlot can compile a pgn file into a binary PolyGlot book and
       furthermore it can merge two such binary books into a third one.

       PolyGlot can also extract some useful information from PolyGlot books.
       The utility "dump-book" dumps the "lines" in a book for a given color.
       By definition a line is a sequence of moves (from the starting
       position) in which the given color makes only book moves and the other
       color makes arbitrary moves (i.e. not necessarily book moves).

       Since a PolyGlot book is built up from positions and not lines there
       may be (and there usually are) many positions in the book that are not
       on a "line" as defined in the previous paragraph. It is convenient to
       call such positions "isolated" positions. The utility "info-book"
       counts such isolated positions.

       Some of the isolated positions are provably unreachable and they could
       in principle be deleted from the book. For example if a book contains
       only the move "e4" in the starting position but also the position after
       "d4 d5" then this last position is provably unreachable since it
       requires white to make a non-book move when a book move is available.
       Such situations arise frequently from the priority rules in merging
       books.

       Unfortunately not all isolated positions are provably unreachable and
       it is difficult to identify the latter. If invoked with "-exact" the
       utility info-book will attempt to count the isolated positions which
       require a player to make a non-book move when a book move is available.
       Due to the possibility of transpositions this is not a fool proof
       method.

       Epd test mode

       In epd test mode, PolyGlot will search positions in an epd file and
       record the number of times the right best move was found.  The
       arguments specify when to stop the search in any given position.

       Perft counts

       A perft count is the number of legal move sequence in a given position
       up to a given depth. PolyGlot can perform such perft counts. It is
       however much slower than other more dedicated programs.

OPTIONS
       When PolyGlot is invoked as an adapter of in epd-test mode it gets its
       options from a config file and then from the command line.  The default
       config file is "polyglot.ini" but an alternative one may be optionally
       included as first argument. The config file format is described below.

       The following engine options may be specified on the command line.

       -noini
           Do not use a config file, even if one was specified on the command
           line.

       -pg The argument is a string of the form <name>=<value>. This option
           will set the Polyglot option <name> to <value>.

       -uci
           The argument is a string of the form <name>=<value>. This option
           will set the engine option <name> to <value>.

       -ec This sets the EngineCommand.

       -ed This sets the EngineDir.

       -en This sets the EngineName.

       -hash
           This is an alias for -uci "Hash=<value>".

       -log
           This is an alias for -pg "Log=true".

       -lf (default: "polyglot.log")
           This is an alias for -pg "LogFile=<value>".

       -bk This is an alias for -pg "Book=true" -pg "BookFile=<value>".

       When invoked as

       polyglot make-book

       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -pgn (default: "book.pgn")
           Input file in pgn format.

       -bin (default: "book.bin")
           Output file in PolyGlot format.

       -max-ply (default: 1024)
           Specifies the maximum ply-depth of lines included in the book.

       -min-game (default: 3)
           Specifies the minimum number of games that have to contain this
           move for it to be included in the book.

       -min-score (default: 0.0)
           Specifies the minimum score (or weight) this move should have
           received for it to  be included in the book. The score is
           2*(wins)+(draws), globally scaled to fit into 16 bits.

       -only-white
           Include only moves for white in the book.

       -only-black
           Include only moves for black in the book.

       -uniform
           Set all weights to 1. In other words, all moves will be selected
           with equal probability.

       When invoked as

       polyglot merge-book

       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -in1
           First input file (in PolyGlot book format).

       -in2
           Second input file (in PolyGlot book format).

       -out (default: out.bin)
           Output file (in PolyGlot book format).

       Input files are not symmetrical, "in1" has priority over "in2". In
       other words when a position occurs both in "in1" and "in2" only the
       moves and weights from "in1" will be retained in "out".

       When invoked as

       polyglot dump-book

       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -bin (default: book.bin)
           Input file in PolyGlot book format.

       -color
           The color for whom to generate the lines.

       -out (default: book_<color>.txt)
           The name of the output file.

       When invoked as

       polyglot info-book

       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -bin (default: book.bin)
           Input file in PolyGlot book format.

       -exact
           Attempt to count the provably unreachable positions among the
           isolated ones.  Note that this takes a very long time.

       When invoked as

       polyglot epd-test

       (possibly with a config file as first argument) PolyGlot supports
       besides the generic options described above the following additional
       options.

       -max-depth (default: 63)
           Unconditionally stop the search when this depth has been reached.

       -max-time (default: 5.0)
           Unconditionally stop the seach after this amount of time.

       -depth-delta (default: 3)
           Stop the search if the solution as been found and the best move has
           been constant for this many depths, on condition that the mininal
           depth and minimal time have been reached.

       -min-depth (default: 8)
           Minimal search depth when the search is stopped using
           "-depth-delta".

       -min-time (default: 1.0)
           Minimal search time when the search is stopped using
           "-depth-delta".

       When invoked as

       polyglot perft

       PolyGlot supports the following options

       -fen (default: starting position)
           Fen at which to start searching.

       -max-depth (default: 1)
           Maximum depth to search.

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       There should be a different config file for each engine.

       The config file is in the traditional INI format.

           [PolyGLot]
           option = value
           ...
           [Engine]
           option = value
           ...

       The characters "#" and ";" serve as comment characters.

       By default initial and final white space is stripped from option
       values. If you want to avoid this, or if you want use one of the
       comment characters # or ; in option values (such as for NalimovPath),
       enclose the value in quotes.

       [PolyGlot] section

       This section is used by PolyGlot only.  The engine is unaware of these
       options.  The list of available options is detailed below.

       EngineName (default: UCI name)
           This is the name that will appear in the GUI.  It is cosmetic only.
           You can use different names for tweaked versions of the same
           engine.

       EngineDir (default: ".")
           Full path of the directory where the engine is installed.  You can
           use "." (without the quotes) if you know that PolyGlot will be
           launched in the engine directory or the engine is in the "path" and
           does not need any data file.

       EngineCommand
           Put here the name of the engine executable file.  You can also add
           command-line arguments.  Path searching is used and the current
           directory will be "EngineDir".

       Log (default: false)
           Whether PolyGlot should log all transactions with the interface and
           the engine.  This should be necessary only to locate problems.

       LogFile (default: polyglot.log)
           The name of the log file.  Note that it is put where PolyGlot was
           launched from, not into the engine directory.

           WARNING: Log files are not cleared between sessions, and can become
           very large.  It is safe to remove them though.

       Resign (default: false)
           Set this to "true" if you want PolyGlot to resign on behalf of the
           engine.

           NOTE: Some engines display buggy scores from time to time although
           the best move is correct.  Use this option only if you know what
           you are doing (e.g. you always check the final position of games).

       ResignMoves (default: 3)
           Number of consecutive moves with "resign" score (see below) before
           PolyGlot resigns for the engine.  Positions with only one legal
           move are ignored.

       ResignScore (default: 600)
           This is the score in centipawns that will trigger resign
           "counting".

       ShowPonder (default: true)
           Show search information during engine pondering.  Turning this off
           might be better for interactive use in some interfaces.

       ScoreWhite (default: true)
           Report score from white's point of view in xboard mode.

       KibitzMove (default: false)
           Whether to kibitz when playing a move.

       KibitzPV (default: false)
           Whether to kibitz when the PV is changed (new iteration or new best
           move).

       KibitzCommand (default: "tellall")
           xboard command to use for kibitzing, normally "tellall" for
           kibitzing or "tellothers" for whispering.

       KibitzDelay (default: 5)
           How many seconds to wait before starting kibitzing.  This has an
           effect only if "KibitzPV" is selected, move kibitzes are always
           sent regardless of the delay.

       KibitzInterval (default: 0)
           This is another form of throttling. PolyGlot will usually wait this
           many seconds before doing the next kibitz.

       UCI (default: false)
           If true PolyGlot will not understand xboard commands.

       MateScore (default: 10000)
           Mate score reported to GUI when in xboard mode.

       Book (default: false)
           Indicates whether a PolyGlot book should be used.  This has no
           effect on the engine own book (which can be controlled with the UCI
           option "OwnBook" in the [Engine] section).  In particular, it is
           possible to use both a PolyGlot book and an engine book.  In that
           case, the engine book will be used whenever PolyGlot is out of
           book.  Remember that PolyGlot is unaware of whether the engine is
           itself using a book or not.

       BookFile (default: book.bin)
           The name of the (binary) book file.  Note that PolyGlot will look
           for it in the directory it was launched from, not in the engine
           directory.  Of course, full path can be used in which case the
           current directory does not matter.

       BookRandom (default: true)
           Select moves according to their weights in the book. If false the
           move with the highest weight is selected.

       BookRandom (default: true)
           Select moves according to their weights in the book. If false the
           move with the highest weight is selected.

       BookDepth (default: 256)
           Stop using the book after this number of moves.

       BookTreshold (default: 5)
           Do not play moves with a weight (probability) lower than this (in
           per mil).

       UseNice (default: false)
           Run the engine at nice level 5, or "NiceValue" if it set.  On some
           operating systems it may be necessary to run the engine at lower
           priority for it to be responsive to commands from PolyGlot while
           searching.

       NiceValue (default: 5)
           Nice levels go from -20 to 20 with 20 being the lowest priority.
           On Unix only root can set negative nice levels. On Windows the
           standard Win32 priority levels are mapped in a sensible way to Unix
           nice levels.

       Affinity (default: -1)
           This a bit vector in which each bit represents the processors that
           a process is allowed to run on. This option works only on Windows.

       Persist (default: true)
           If true then PolyGlot will implement persistence by loading options
           from an additional INI file whose name is by default derived from
           the engine name. At exit PolyGlot will also save its options to
           this INI file.

       PersistFile (default: <EngineName>.ini)
           The name of the file from which to take the additional options.  It
           is probably best to stick with the default. You can safely edit
           this file, or delete it to restore the default options.

       PersistDir (default: $HOME/.polyglot on Linux; ".\Polyglot Settings" on
       Windows)
           The directory where the PersistFile is stored.

       Work arounds

       Work arounds are identical to options except that they should be used
       only when necessary.  Their purpose is to try to hide problems with
       various software (not just engines).

       IMPORTANT: Any of these work arounds might be removed in future
       versions of PolyGlot.  You are strongly recommended to contact the
       author of faulty software and truly fix the problem.

       PolyGlot supports the following work arounds:

       UCIVersion (default: 2)
           The default value of 2 corresponds to UCI+.  Use 1 to select plain
           UCI for engines that have problems with UCI+.

       CanPonder (default: false)
           PolyGlot now conforms to the documented UCI behaviour: the engine
           will be allowed to ponder only if it (the engine) declares the
           "Ponder" UCI option.  However some engines which can actually
           ponder do not declare the option.  This work around lets PolyGlot
           know that they can ponder.

       SyncStop (default: false)
           When a ponder miss occurs, Polyglot interrupts the engine and
           IMMEDIATELY launches a new search.  While there should be no
           problem with this, some engines seem confused and corrupt their
           search board.  "SyncStop" forces PolyGlot to wait for the (now
           useless) ponder search to finish before launching the new search.

       PromoteWorkAround (default: false)
           Some engines do not specify a promotion piece, e.g. they send
           "e7e8" instead of the correct "e7e8q".  This work around enables
           the incorrect form (and of course promotes into a queen).

       RepeatPV (default: true)
           When true, PolyGlot repeats the last pv string (which also contains
           score,depth and time usage) it got from the engine. Some engines
           however do not send a new pv string just before sending the move.
           In that case the output of PolyGlot would be inconsistent.  When
           RepeatPV is false PolyGlot does not repeat the last pv string.  Due
           to the way kibitzing is implemented, KibitzMove is disabled in that
           case.

       WbWorkArounds (default: true)
           The intention of these options is to provide work arounds for
           xboard/winboard bugs should they arise.  This one decapitalizes the
           word Draw in options that contain this word. Some versions of
           xboard/winboard contain a bug which causes such options to be
           interpreted as draw claims by the engine.

           Engines that send options with "Draw" in their name are Rybka and
           HIARCS.

       WbWorkArounds2 (default: false)
           Old version of Winboard clear the engine output window at depth 1.
           With this work around PG will send info lines at depth >=2. This
           may or may not improve the display.

       [Engine] section

       This section contains engine UCI options.  PolyGlot does not understand
       them, but sends the information to the engine at startup (converted to
       UCI form).  You can add any UCI option that makes sense to the engine
       (not just the common options about hash-table size and tablebases).

       NOTE: use INI syntax, not UCI.  For example "OwnBook = true" is
       correct.  It will be replaced by PolyGlot with "setoption name OwnBook
       value true" at engine startup.

       Standard UCI options are

           Hash
           NalimovPath
           NalimovCache
           OwnBook

       Hidden options like "Ponder" or "UCI_xxx" are automatic and should not
       be put in an INI file.

       The other options are engine-specific.  Check their name using a UCI
       GUI or launch the engine in a console and type "uci".

EXAMPLES
       Running the UCI engine "fruit" under xboard 4.3.15 and later (this
       invokes PolyGlot internally).

           xboard -fcp fruit -fUCI

       An explicit command line for using the UCI engine "fruit" with 128M
       hash in xboard with logging enabled (this also works on xboard 4.2.7).

           xboard -fcp "polyglot -noini -log -ec fruit -hash 128"

       The equivalent config file would be:

           [PolyGlot]
           EngineCommand = fruit
           Log = true
           [Engine]
           Hash=128

       Compile "games.pgn" into a book "book.bin" retaining all lines of at
